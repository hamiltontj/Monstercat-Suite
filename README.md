A WIP rainmeter suite based on the Monstercat Visulizer skin by marcopixel.

Includes Do I need a jacket support from FlyingHyrax, multiple system info and networking meters. More to come

TODO in order of priority
- [X] Add optional DINAJ versions with reduced text
- [ ] Design and add in text and text with bars versions of currently existing meters
- [ ] Making Monstercat clock for images show images in a directory and slideshow through them
- [X] Add backgrounds to everything so clicking is not a pain (Will become very useful for text only meters
- [ ] Look into adding better HDD bars, as perfmon does not have a way to get max possible HDD usage.
- [ ] Add news RSS
- [ ] Weather stuffs (May be hard with free weather services (yahoo) shutting down and not wanting to expose private keys for weather apps, may look into how DINAJ is doing it
- [ ] Calender for the month meter
- [ ] Appointments meter
- [ ] Add blur effect to album art background toggle, since as I learned album art is not high res
- [ ] Update auto color gen and make it have multiple shades, possibly pull from album art since it will be a background option
- [ ] Add missing part of DINAJ hovertext
- [ ] Fix issues with ping and GPU conditionals
- [ ] Fix spacing issue on Monstercat clock
- [ ] Fix user config for update frequency not working
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] Update installer
- [ ] Look into hacking in Google play music (And youtube?) support to the music reader (I believe Google Talk/G+ used to expose this info)
